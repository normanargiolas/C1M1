/**
 * @file stat.c
 * @brief Simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset.
 *
 * In this programming assignment you will create a simple application that performs
 * statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help you get re-oriented
 * with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. We begin by setting up a
 * version control repository on your local machine. You will then develop and test
 * your code there. When complete, you will upload a zip of your repository to Coursera.
 * Please read through all instructions before starting.
